# This file defines the tags available to analyzers when creating issues.
# An issue can have any number of tags, and each tag consists of one or
# more arbitrary values. The tags don't affect the analyzers internally,
# but they can affect the output of the report generated by dmu-analyze
# so that developers can peruse their modules' issues in various ways.
#
# See hasTag(), getTag(), setTag(), and clearTag() in IssueInterface.
